NAME:
    VORONOI_2D_BINNING

AUTHOR:
      Michele Cappellari, University of Oxford
      michele.cappellari_at_physics.ox.ac.uk

PURPOSE:
      Perform adaptive spatial binning of Integral-Field Spectroscopic
      (IFS) data to reach a chosen constant signal-to-noise ratio per bin.
      This method is required for the proper analysis of IFS
      observations, but can also be used for standard photometric
      imagery or any other two-dimensional data.
      This program precisely implements the algorithm described in
      section 5.1 of the reference below.

EXPLANATION:
      Further information on VORONOI_2D_BINNING algorithm can be found in
      Cappellari M., Copin Y., 2003, MNRAS, 342, 345
      http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003MNRAS.342..345C

CALLING SEQUENCE:

        binNum, xBin, yBin, xBar, yBar, sn, nPixels, scale = \
            voronoi_2d_binning(x, y, signal, noise, targetSN,
                               cvt=True, pixelsize=None, plot=True,
                               quiet=True, sn_func=None, wvt=True)

INPUTS:
           X: Vector containing the X coordinate of the pixels to bin.
              Arbitrary units can be used (e.g. arcsec or pixels).
              In what follows the term "pixel" refers to a given
              spatial element of the dataset (sometimes called "spaxel" in
              the IFS community): it can be an actual pixel of a CCD
              image, or a spectrum position along the slit of a long-slit
              spectrograph or in the field of view of an IFS
              (e.g. a lenslet or a fiber).
              It is assumed here that pixels are arranged in a regular
              grid, so that the pixel size is a well defined quantity.
              The pixel grid however can contain holes (some pixels can be
              excluded from the binning) and can have an irregular boundary.
              See the above reference for an example and details.
           Y: Vector (same size as X) containing the Y coordinate
              of the pixels to bin.
      SIGNAL: Vector (same size as X) containing the signal
              associated with each pixel, having coordinates (X,Y).
              If the `pixels' are actually the apertures of an
              integral-field spectrograph, then the signal can be
              defined as the average flux in the spectral range under
              study, for each aperture.
              If pixels are the actual pixels of the CCD in a galaxy
              image, the signal will be simply the counts in each pixel.
       NOISE: Vector (same size as X) containing the corresponding
              noise (1 sigma error) associated with each pixel.
    TARGETSN: The desired signal-to-noise ratio in the final
              2D-binned data. E.g. a S/N~50 per pixel may be a
              reasonable value to extract stellar kinematics
              information from galaxy spectra.

KEYWORDS:
         CVT: Set this keyword to skip the Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation
              (CVT) step (vii) of the algorithm in Section 5.1 of
              Cappellari & Copin (2003).
              This may be useful if the noise is strongly non Poissonian,
              the pixels are not optimally weighted, and the CVT step
              appears to introduces significant gradients in the S/N.
              A similar alternative consists of using the /WVT keyword below.
        PLOT: Set this keyword to produce a plot of the two-dimensional
              bins and of the corresponding S/N at the end of the
              computation.
     PIXSIZE: Optional pixel scale of the input data.
              This can be the size of a pixel of an image or the size
              of a spaxel or lenslet in an integral-field spectrograph.
            - The value is computed automatically by the program, but
              this can take a long times when (X, Y) have many elements.
              In those cases the PIXSIZE keyword should be given.
     SN_FUNC: Generic function to calculate the S/N of a bin with spaxels
              "index" with the form: "sn = func(index, signal, noise)".
              If this keyword is not set, or is set to None, the program
              uses the _sn_func(), included in the program file, but
              another function can be adopted if needed.
              See the documentation of _sn_func() for more details.
       QUIET: by default the program shows the progress while accreting
              pixels and then while iterating the CVT. Set this keyword
              to avoid printing progress results.
         WVT: When this keyword is set, the routine bin2d_cvt_equal_mass is
              modified as proposed by Diehl & Statler (2006, MNRAS, 368, 497).
              In this case the final step of the algorithm, after the bin-accretion
              stage, is not a modified Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation, but it uses
              a Weighted Voronoi Tessellation.
              This may be useful if the noise is strongly non Poissonian,
              the pixels are not optimally weighted, and the CVT step
              appears to introduces significant gradients in the S/N.
              A similar alternative consists of using the /NO_CVT keyword above.
              If you use the /WVT keyword you should also include a reference to
              `the WVT modification proposed by Diehl & Statler (2006).'

OUTPUTS:
   BINNUMBER: Vector (same size as X) containing the bin number assigned
              to each input pixel. The index goes from zero to Nbins-1.
              IMPORTANT: THIS VECTOR ALONE IS ENOUGH TO MAKE *ANY* SUBSEQUENT
              COMPUTATION ON THE BINNED DATA. EVERYTHING ELSE IS OPTIONAL!

        XBIN: Vector (size Nbins) of the X coordinates of the bin generators.
              These generators uniquely define the Voronoi tessellation.
              Note: USAGE OF THIS VECTOR IS DEPRECATED AS IT CAN CAUSE CONFUSION
        YBIN: Vector (size Nbins) of Y coordinates of the bin generators.
              Note: USAGE OF THIS VECTOR IS DEPRECATED AS IT CAN CAUSE CONFUSION
        XBAR: Vector (size Nbins) of X coordinates of the bins luminosity
              weighted centroids. Useful for plotting interpolated data.
        YBAR: Vector (size Nbins) of Y coordinates of the bins luminosity
              weighted centroids.
          SN: Vector (size Nbins) with the final SN of each bin.
     NPIXELS: Vector (size Nbins) with the number of pixels of each bin.
       SCALE: Vector (size Nbins) with the scale length of the Weighted
              Voronoi Tessellation, when the /WVT keyword is set.
              In that case SCALE is *needed* together with the coordinates
              XBIN and YBIN of the generators, to compute the tessellation
              (but one can also simply use the BINNUMBER vector).

          MC, Leiden, 4 August 2004
      V2.4.3: Corrected bug introduced in version 2.3.1. It went undetected
          for a long time because it could only happen in special conditions.
          Now we recompute the index of the good bins after computing all
          centroids of the reassigned bins in reassign_bad_bins. Many thanks

          pointing out the usefulness of dealing with negative signal.
          MC, Leiden, 23 December 2005
      V2.5.0: Added two new lines of code and the corresponding /WVT keyword
          to implement the nice modification to the algorithm proposed by
          Diehl & Statler (2006). MC, Leiden, 9 March 2006
      V2.5.1: Updated documentation. MC, Oxford, 3 November 2006

          MC, Oxford, 11 November 2011
      V2.5.7: Included safety termination criterion of Lloyd algorithm
          to prevent loops using /WVT. MC, Oxford, 24 March 2012
      V2.5.8: Update Voronoi tessellation at the exit of bin2d_cvt_equal_mass.
          This is only done when using /WVT, as DIFF may not be zero at the
          last iteration. MC, La Palma, 15 May 2012
      V2.6.0: Included new SN_FUNCTION to illustrate the fact that the user can
          define his own function to estimate the S/N of a bin if needed.

          reporting the problem and providing the solution.
          MC, Oxford, 31 March 2016
      V3.0.4: Included keyword "sn_func" to pass a function which
          calculates the S/N of a bin, rather than editing _sn_func().
          Included test to prevent the addition of a pixel from
          ever decreasing the S/N during the accretion stage.
          MC, Oxford, 12 April 2016
      V3.0.5: Fixed deprecation warning in Numpy 1.11. MC, Oxford, 18 April 2016
      V3.0.6: Use interpolation='nearest' to avoid crash on MacOS.
          Thanks to Kyle Westfall (Portsmouth) for reporting the problem.
          Allow for zero noise. MC, Oxford, 14 June 2016
      V3.0.7: Print execution time. MC, Oxford, 23 January 2017
      V3.0.8: New voronoi_tessellation() function. MC, Oxford, 15 February 2017
      V3.0.9: Do not iterate down to diff==0 in _cvt_equal_mass().
          Request `pixelsize` when dataset is large. Thanks to Davor Krajnovic
          (Potsdam) for the feedback. Make `quiet` really quiet.
          Fixd some instances where sn_func() was not being used (only relevant
          when passing the `sn_func` keyword). MC, Oxford, 10 July 2017
      V3.1.0: Use cKDTree for un-weighted Voronoi Tessellation.
          Removed loop over bins from Lloyd's algorithm with CVT.
          MC, Oxford, 17 July 2017

    The Voronoi binning algorithm does not require this function to have a

    There is also no need for sn_func() to return the actual S/N.
    Instead sn_func() could return any quantity the user needs to equalize.

    For example sn_func() could be a procedure which uses ppxf to measure
    the velocity dispersion from the coadded spectrum of spaxels "index"
    and returns the relative error in the dispersion.

NAME:
    display_bins(x, y, binNum, velBin)

AUTHOR:
    Michele Cappellari, University of Oxford
    E-mail: michele.cappellari_at_physics.ox.ac.uk

PURPOSE:
    This simple routine illustrates how to display a Voronoi binned map.

INPUTS:
    (x, y): (length npix) Coordinates of the original spaxels before binning;
    binNum: (length npix) Bin number corresponding to each (x, y) pair,
            as provided in output by the voronoi_2d_binning() routine;
    velBin: (length nbins) Quantity associated to each bin, resulting
            e.g. from the kinematic extraction from the binned spectra.
